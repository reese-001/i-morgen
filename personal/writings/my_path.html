    <strong>All job markets evolve. </strong><br/><br/>


    <p>One of the largest drivers of the job market evolution is IT. And these driving forces apply pressure across all professions - including the IT profession itself. This pressure is constant and pervasive. If we become ignorant or numb to this pressure, we substantially increase our risk exposure. <br/><br/>
    
    I feel this pressure. It is both frightening and exhilarating. It is frightening in the sense that we are alone in the open sea and subjected to powers that are much greater than we are. We alone must understand and navigate our situation. <br/><br/>
    
    It is exhilarating in the sense that as long as we are alive, we are never without resources. Like a puzzle, we can identify and assemble these resources in ways that guide us to new challenges and successes. And in the end, we can become better for the experience. <br/><br/></p>
    
    
    
    <strong>A challenging experience</strong><br/><br/>
    
    
    <p>In pursuit of the puzzle mentioned above, I recently had a job offer extended to me to relocate and work in Europe. I can confidently say my excitement was immeasurable and as a family we moved forward with the challenging task of preparing for an international move. <br/><br/>
    
    We spent countless hours preparing for and acquiring our European residence permits. We repainted, decluttered, staged and listed the house. We withdrew the children from school and had an apartment in Europe secured. I was six days away from turning in my notice. It was an overwhelming experience, but we could see it was coming to a successful conclusion. <br/><br/>
    
    So when I received an email on that Thursday morning informing me that the position had been cut and the offer rescinded, it was as if someone reached into me and pulled. And like a ball of yarn, I unraveled and there was nothing. <br/><br/>
    
    But nothingness was not an option. I had a family who had just experienced the same devastation and I still had my job that was currently placing urgent demands on me. So for the next several days I went on - nothing but a hollow shell. <br/><br/></p>
    

    <strong>And Now â€¦ </strong><br/><br/>
    
    <p> I have several recurring thoughts as I reflect on that experience. One of them is that if I had been better qualified for that position, my potential employer would have been more motivated to fully onboard me. Taken to an extreme, if I had been the smartest and most qualified person in the world for that position, they would accept any sacrifice to fully onboard me. <br/><br/>
    
    That reflection is nothing but an idle thought experiment. I will never be the smartest person in the world. But I can be among the smartest people in the room. What does that room look like? For me it represents the nexus of cloud technology, data science and devops.<br/><br/>
    
    This is my humble path. I will assemble the resources that I have and I will follow it with the pressures of the job market to my back. And it will be exhilarating. <br/><br/>
