        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">Objectives and Key Results</span></strong></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Three components to OKR's</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Objectives</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tells you where to go</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Key Results</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps you measure</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Initiatives</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Everything you will do to achieve your key results</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Objectives</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tells you something you would like to achieve in the future</li>
            <li>Sets direction for your organizaiton or team</li>
            <li>Should be ambitious, but achievable</li>
            <li>Should be ...</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to understand</li>
                <li>Memorable</li>
                <li>Inspiring</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Should not  ...</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Contain technican jargon</li>
                <li>Contain a metric</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Example: Our customers are the happiest they have ever been</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Key Results</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Results that need to be achieved in order to get to your Objective</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Analogy: Your desired destination is New York (Objective). The sign posts indicating distance towards your destination are your Key Results </li>
            </ul>
            <li>A good Key Result is typically an outcome and not an output </li>
            <ul>
                <li>An output is simply something that you do (ie project or task such as making 50 sales calls)</li>
                <li>An outcome is a result of what you do. (ie closing 10 new customers)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Key results have two functions</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Help specify the Objective: Objectives are qualitative and are quantified in Key Results</li>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: Objective is to be the best place to work in the United States. Key results could be:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Where we rank in Fortune's 100 top places to work list</li>
                        <li>How many people apply for a job at our company</li>
                        <li>How many people leave our company</li>
                        <li>* Quantify it so it reads like "Increase employee NPS score from 30 to 50"</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                
                <li>Help measure progress toward your Objective</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Key metric must contain</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A metric</li>
                        <li>A start value</li>
                        <li>A target value</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Initiatives</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the projects and tasks you will do in order to push progress on your Key Results</li>
            <li>Another way to look at it: Everything you will do to get to your destination</li>
            <li>Examples of Initiatives may be:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Resolve all high priority bugs in our product</li>
                <li>Hire two new support agents</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Difference between goals and OKR's</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>OKR's are two things</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Framework that contains best practices to help you manage your organizational goals</li>
                <li>Also a way to formulate those goals</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Example</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Goals:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goal: Increase brand awareness for your business</li>
                    <li>Goal: Acquire 20,000 new leads per month</li>
                    <li>Goal: Setup 10 ad campaigns</li>
                    <li>Goal: Write 5 new blog posts per month</li>
                    <li>* End result: you end up with a list of goals that all feel equally important. The only thing that really matters is to increase brand awareness</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Goals:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objective: Our brand is the talk of the town</li>
                    <li>Key Result: Acquire 20,000 new leads per month</li>
                    <li>Initiatives: Set up 10 ad campaigns, write 5 new blog posts per month</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">OKR's vs KPI's</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are KPI's</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance measurement to evaluate the success, output, quantity, or quality of an ongoing process or activity</li>
            </ul>
            <li>What are OKP's (in this context specifically)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide the missing link between ambition and reality</li>
                <li>Goals that help you break the status quo and take you into new, often unknown, territory</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>OKR's and KPI's work well together</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Analogy: your organiztion is a car and your driving to your destination</li>
            <li>KPI's are the constant things you need to watch, such as what you find on your dashboard (ie fuel gauge and engine temperature gauge)</li>
            <li>OKR's are temporary like landmarks that guide you to your destination</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">History</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>OKR's date back to 1954 when Peter Drucker wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Management-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/0060878975/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OGU1EWI7J41Q&keywords=the+practice+of+management+peter+drucker&qid=1671293581&sprefix=The+Practice+of+Management%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Practice of Management</a> in which he first described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives" target="_blank">Management By Objectives</a>, also known as MBO</li>
            <li>In 1968 Andrew Grove cofounded Intel. Andy became known as the <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Andy-Grove-considered-the-father-of-OKRs" target="_blank">Father of OKR's</a> and further developed and refined MBO into the framework we know it today</li>
            <li>In 1974 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr" target="_blank">John Doerr</a> joined Intel and learned about the key concepts of OKR</li>
            <li>Doerr went on to join Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, one of the first major investors in Google and he became an advisor to Google in its early days. Introduced OKR's to Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Executing Strategy with OKR</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Companies want to ensure everyone is pulling in the same direction and towards a common goal</li>
            <li>Before OKR can boost alignment, you need to get your strategy in place</li>
            <li>Every organization has limited resources and is faced with competition </li>
            <li>For that reason, strategy becomes critical and tough choices will have to be made</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Which battles do you want to fight (and which do you want to avoid)</li>
                <li>What does winning look like</li>
                <li>The answers are your strategy</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Strategy consists of two parts</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Ultimate goal</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defines your organization's ultimate winning aspirations</li>
                    <li>Making clear what the purpose of your business is, for whom your organiation is fulfilling that purpose, and when you consider your venture a success</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Strategic Pillars</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "how to win" choices that reflec what you will do to differentiate yourself in the market</li>
                    <li><a href="../images/okr_strategic_pillars.png" target="_blank">Strategic pillars (perdoo)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <li>If you change your ultimate goal, you must re-evaluate your strategic pillars</li>
            </ol>
            
        </ul>
