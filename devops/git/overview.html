		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Git has three main types of entities that it tracks</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Files</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Git tracks changes made to individual files in your repository</li>
					<li>Every time you make a change to a file, Git records that change as a "commit"</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Commits</li>
				<ul>
					<li>A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time</li>
					<li>Every commit contains a set of changes to the files in your repository, along with a message that describes the changes</li>
					<li>Commits are identified by a unique hash, and they form a linear history of your repository</li>
				</ul>
				<li><a href="branching.html" target="_blank">Branches</a></li>
				<ul>
					<li>A branch is a pointer to a specific commit in your repository</li>
					<li>By default, Git has a single branch named "master", but you can create additional branches to track different versions of your code</li>
					<li>Branches allow you to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously, without interfering with each other</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<br/>
        <div id="best_practices">
            <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Best Practices</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid checking in code to the main branch, use feature branches instead</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Why?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Branches allow code reviews via pull requests</li>
					<li>Branches help avoid breaking the code</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How? (specific to CodeCommit)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Limit pushes and merges to branches via IAM deny policies</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Allows you to create groups (ie. senior vs junior devs) and allow seniors to initiate pull requests</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Keep commits small and focused</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Why?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Makes it easier to track changes and revert changes if necessary</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Each commit should ideally have a single focus and should contain only related changes</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Write clear and concise commit messages</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Why?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Allow reviewers and others to understand what is going on</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The commit message should summarize the changes made in the commit and should be written in a clear and concise manner</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>

        <div id="storing_data">
            <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Storing Data</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Upon commit, Git stores a snapshot of the entire file, not a diff</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This allows Git to provide a clearer view of your code changes over time</li>
				<li>Makes it easier to revert to a previous version in your codebase</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Git is built for speed, not for storage optimzation</li>
			<ul>
				<li>To see this, review the files in the .git/objects directory</li>
				<li>There are no delta files</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Pack operation (git pack) is used to create a single compressed file that contains multiple Git objects, such as commits, trees, blobs</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Output is called a pack file</li>
				<li>Typically performed automatically by Git (along with other routine items such as git gc)</li>
				<li>You can perform manually however</li>
				<li>Things to keep in mind</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pack files are read only</li>
					<li>When Git needs to access a Git object that is stored in a pack file, it will first look for an index file that maps the object's SHA-1 hash to its location in the pack file. If the index file does not exist, Git will create one automatically</li>
					<li>If a Git object is not present in the pack file, Git will retrieve it from its original location in the repository</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>** UNCONFIRMED **</li>
			<li>The name "git" is a reference to the British slang term "git", which is a derogatory term for a foolish or unpleasant person</li>
			<li>The name was chosen by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Git, as a way to poke fun at himself and the challenges he had faced while developing the tool</li>
			<li>According to Torvalds, he initially intended to call the tool "The Stupid Content Tracker" as a nod to the fact that he had been frustrated with existing version control tools</li>
			<li>However, he decided to name the tool "git" instead, as he felt that it was a more memorable name</li>
