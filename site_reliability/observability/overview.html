		<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What is observability</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Observability is the practice of designing systems in such a way that they can be monitored, understood, and debugged.</li>
			<li>It is a key aspect of maintaining and improving the performance, reliability, and resilience of modern systems.</li></li>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Pillars</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Metrics</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are numerical values that represent the state or behavior of a system at a particular point in time</li>
				<li>Metrics can be collected from various parts of a system, such as server logs, application performance, network traffic, or resource utilization.</li>
				<li>By tracking these metrics over time, it is possible to understand how a system is behaving and identify potential issues or trends.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Logs</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are records of events that have occurred within a system.</li>
				<li>Logs can be generated by various components of a system, such as servers, applications, or infrastructure, and can provide valuable insights into how a system is functioning</li>
				<li>By analyzing logs, it is possible to understand the sequence of events that led to a particular issue or to identify patterns that may indicate a problem.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Traces</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are detailed records of the execution of a particular request or transaction as it flows through a system</li>
				<li>Traces can provide a detailed view of how a request is processed, including which components are involved and how long each step takes</li>
				<li>By analyzing traces, it is possible to understand how a system is performing and identify bottlenecks or performance issues.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>How to create a culture of observability</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make observability a priority: Observability should be viewed as an essential part of the development and operations process, rather than an afterthought. This means allocating the necessary resources (e.g., time, personnel, tools) to ensure that observability is integrated into the design and operation of systems.</li>
			<li>Encourage a growth mindset: Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement by fostering a growth mindset. This means encouraging a culture of experimentation, asking questions, and seeking feedback to learn from successes and failures.</li>
			<li>Foster collaboration: Observability requires cross-functional collaboration between development, operations, and other teams. Encourage collaboration and communication across teams to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.</li>
			<li>Empower teams: Empower teams to make decisions and take ownership of their systems. This means giving teams the autonomy and responsibility to design, build, and operate their systems in a way that enables observability.</li>
			<li>Provide the right tools and resources: Ensure that teams have the right tools and resources to enable observability, such as monitoring and logging systems, performance and stress testing tools, and training or documentation.</li>
