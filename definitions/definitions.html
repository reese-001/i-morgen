                </td>
<td>
                    a method of testing software where the tester does not have access to the internal structure of the code being tested. The tester interacts with the software purely through its external interfaces, such as a graphical user interface or an API, and has no knowledge of the underlying code.

                </td>
<td>
                    a security measure that involves associating a host with its X509 certificate or public key and storing it locally on the client device. The client can then verify the identity of the host by comparing the stored certificate or public key to the one presented by the host during SSL/TLS negotiation, helping to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
