			<li>Transformer deep learning architectures are what is hot</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Transformer deep learning architectures are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequences of data, such as text, speech, or time series</li>
				<li>Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence, allowing the network to capture long-range dependencies in the data.</li>>
				<li>Transformers are based on the idea of using multiple parallel attention layers, rather than sequential recurrent or convolutional layers, to process the input sequence. This allows for faster training and inference compared to traditional RNNs and CNNs</li>
				<li>Transformer architectures have been successful in a wide range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and question answering, and have become a cornerstone of modern NLP models</li>
			</ul>
			<li>BERT: (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>A transformer-based deep learning model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data to generate contextualized word representations</li>
				<li>BERT is designed to capture the meaning of words in context and to generate dense representations that capture the relationships between words in a sentence</li>
			</ul>
			<li>GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer</li>
