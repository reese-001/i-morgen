			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Object Lock</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon S3 Object Lock is a feature that enables customers to store objects in an immutable state, meaning that they cannot be deleted or overwritten for a specified retention period. </li>
			<li>Object Lock is designed to help customers meet regulatory requirements, such as those related to record retention and compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>
			<li>With Object Lock, customers can store objects in one of two modes:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Governance mode: Objects stored in governance mode cannot be deleted or overwritten for a specified retention period, which can range from days to years.</li>
				<li>Compliance mode: Objects stored in compliance mode cannot be deleted or overwritten until the end of a specified retention period, known as a legal hold</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>

		<div id="analytics">
			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">S3 Analytics</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon S3 Analytics is a feature that enables customers to collect, store, and analyze data stored in Amazon S3</li>
			<li>With S3 Analytics, customers can run SQL-like queries on their S3 data to extract insights and perform data analysis.</li>
			<li>S3 Analytics supports two types of data analysis:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Inventory: Inventory provides metadata about objects stored in an S3 bucket, such as the object's key, size, and last modified date. </li>
				<li>Metrics: Metrics enable customers to collect and analyze data about how their objects are accessed, such as the number of reads and writes to an object, the source of the request, and the response status code</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<div id="multi_part_uploads">
			<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Multi Part Uploads</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) multi-part uploads allow you to upload large objects, such as videos or backups, more efficiently to S3.</li>
			<li>With multi-part uploads, you can upload parts of an object in parallel to improve the upload speed.</li>
			<li>Minimum part size is 5 MB, maximum part size is 5 GB.</li>
			<li>Recommended in the following scenarios</li>
			<ul>
				<li>If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance.</li>
				<li>If you're uploading large objects over a network with limited bandwidth, use multipart uploading to minimize the impact of network latency on your upload time.</li>
			</ul>
