        <p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Code Build</strong></span></p>
		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>What is it?</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.</li>
			<li>CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers.</li>
			<li>It scales continuously and processes multiple builds concurrently, so your builds are not left waiting in a queue.</li>
			<li>You can get started quickly by using prepackaged build environments, or you can create custom build environments that use your own build tools.</li>
			<li>You can also fully automate the build process by using the AWS SDKs to integrate CodeBuild with your source control repository and deployment pipeline.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Workflow</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Trigger CodeBuild through console, SDK, CLI or most commonly, CodePipeline</li>
			<li>Must setup CodeBuild environment</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose from pre-built environments</li>
				<li>Or create your own via a Docker image typically stored in ECR</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Provide your source control, typically from CodeCommit, GitHib, etc</li>
			<li>Execution occurs as defined in Buildspec.yml which is typically included in your source code</li>
			<ul>
				<li>NOTE: this can be overriden on the CLI</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Build environments</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Docker images are managed by CodeBuild</li>
			<li>Check the image to see what is preinstalled</li>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Timeouts</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Refer to the maximum amount of time that a build is allowed to run before it is stopped.</li>
			<li>There are two types of timeouts in CodeBuild:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Build timeout</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Applies to the entire build process, including the time it takes to download the source code, execute the build commands, and upload the build artifacts.</li>
					<li>You can set the build timeout to any value between 5 minutes and 1 day.</li>
					<li>If the build takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be stopped and marked as a failure.</li>

				</ul>
				<li>Individual phase timeout</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This timeout applies to each phase of the build process separately</li>
					<li>There are three phases in a CodeBuild build</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Pre-Build: This phase occurs before the build starts, and is typically used to download the source code and install any dependencies.</li>
						<li>Build: This phase is where the build commands are executed.</li>
						<li>Post-build: This phase occurs after the build has completed, and is typically used to upload the build artifacts to Amazon S3 or another storage location.</li>
						<li>If any phase takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be stopped and the build will be marked as a failure.</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
			</ol>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Use Cases</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Build and test code</li>
			<li>Compile code</li>
			<li>Run unit tests</li>
			<li>Package artifacts</li>
			<li>Deploy artifacts</li>

			<li>Generate out static pages from a JAMstack</li>
			<li>A website built with Gastby needs to render out static pages and delivery for a S3 static website hosting</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Trigger with AWS Console</li>
				<li>CodeBuild will pull from its source (CodeCommit)</li>
				<li>CodeBiuld will render out static pages to S3</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Developer needs to ensure their code passes all tests before being allowed to make a Pull Request</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Push code to a feature branch</li>
				<li>Github will trigger a web hook that triggers a lambda function using AWS SDK</li>
				<li>CodeBuild pulls down project and runs build commands</li>
				<li>Test coverage results passed to another lambda function and back to GitHub </li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Buildspec.yml</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provides the build instructions and needs to be at the root of your project folder</li>
			<li>Components</li>
			<ul>
				<li>version: .2 recommended</li>
				<li>Affects default shell in the build environment</li>
				<ul>
					<li>v .1 runs each build command in a seperate instance</li>
					<li>v .2 runns all build commands in the same instance</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Phases: commands the run in each phase of the build</li>
				<ul>
					<li>install: only for installing packed in the build env</li>
					<li>pre_build: commands that run before builing</li>
					<li>build: commands that run during build</li>
					<li>post-build: commands that run after build</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Artifacts: where we can find the build output and how to prepare it for uploading to the S3 output bucket</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
