		<div id="what_is_it">
			<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>What is it?</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>A version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) in the cloud</li>
			<li>It is a fully managed source control service that makes it easy for companies to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories</li>
			<li>Based on Git and similar to GitHub, BitBucket and GitLab</li>
		</ul>

		<br/>
		<div id="features">
			<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Features</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Complies with many compliance programs (ie HIPAA)</li>
			<li>Repos encrypted at rest as well as in transit</li>
			<li>Can handle repos with large number of files or branches, large file sizes and lengthy revision histories</li>
			<li>No limit on the size of your repo or on the file types you can store</li>
			<li>Keeps your repos close to your other production resources in AWS</li>
			<li>Integrates with IAM to control which users have access to specific repos</li>
		</ul>

		<br/>
		<div id="authorization">
			<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Authorization</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>IAM user SSH keys</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are SSH keys that are associated with an IAM user and can be used to authenticate the user when accessing CodeCommit repositories over SSH.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>IAM user HTTPS credentials</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are a username and password combination that are associated with an IAM user and can be used to authenticate the user when accessing CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>AWS CodeCommit credential helper</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This is a command-line tool that allows you to use Git credentials stored in the AWS Secrets Manager to access CodeCommit repositories. The credential helper allows you to use Git with CodeCommit without having to store your credentials in a file on your local machine.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Git credentials</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are a username and password combination that can be used to authenticate with CodeCommit repositories over HTTPS. Git credentials are typically stored in a file on your local machine and are used by the Git command-line tool to authenticate with CodeCommit.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>SSH keys</li>
			<ul>
				<li>These are SSH keys that are associated with a user's local machine and can be used to authenticate the user when accessing CodeCommit repositories over SSH</li>
			</ul>
			<li>** Note that IAM user SSH keys and IAM user HTTPS credentials are specific to IAM users, while Git credentials and SSH keys are not tied to any particular AWS identity.</li>
		</ul>

		<br/>
		<div id="setup">
			<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Setup</strong></span></p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>To create the repo, you must initially provide a repo name. Optionally you can provide descriptions and tags</li>
			<li>There are three ways of connecting to the repo</li>
			<ul>
				<li>HTTPS</li>
				<ul>
					<li>For non root users, credentials are available via IAM user/security credentials</li>
				</ul>
				<li>SSH (non root access)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>For non root users, credentials are available via IAM user/security credentials</li>
				</ul>
				<li>HTTPS (GRC) </li>
				<ul> 
					<li>GRC = git-remote-codecommit</li>
					<li>Provides a simple method for pushing and pulling code from CodeCommit repositories by extending Git</li>
					<li>It is the recommended method for supporting connections made with federated access, identity providers, and temporary credentials</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>

			<li>For more information on git, see <a href="../../devops/git/overview.html" target="_blank">link</a></li>
			<li>Hosting</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Git: Can be hosted in many locations</li>
				<li>CodeCommit: Fully managed service hosted by AWS</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Integration with other AWS services</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Git: This can generally happen, but it requires additional setup</li>
				<li>CodeCommit: Tightly integrated into CodeBuild and CodePipeline</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Access control</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Git: Offers fine grained controls, but the specifics will vary depending on the platform and configuration</li>
				<li>CodeCommit: Also offers fine grained controls but controlled via IAM</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Scalability</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Git:  Can scale as needed, but you need to consider infrastructure requirements</li>
				<li>CodeCommit: Designed to support large teams and complex workflows</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Cost</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Git: Generally free, but may accure costs associated with hosting and managing the infrastructure</li>
				<li>CodeCommit: Pay as you go model, costs based on number of repos and users - as well as data transfer and storage usage</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
