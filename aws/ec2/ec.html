		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>EC2</strong></span></strong></p>
		<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>What is it?</strong></span></strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>EC2 is a highly configurable server</li>
			<li>Resizable compute capacity</li>
			<li>Takes minutes to launch new instances</li>
			<li>Anything and everything on AWS uses EC2 instance underneath</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Instance Types and Usage</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>General Purpose</li>
			<ul>
				<li>A1, T3, T3a, T2, M5, M5a, M4</li>
				<li>Balance of compute, memory, and network resources</li>
				<li>Use case: web and code repos</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Compute Optimized</li>
			<ul>
				<li>C5, C5n, C4</li>
				<li>Ideal for compute bound applicaitons that benefit from high performance processor</li>
				<li>Use case: scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers, ad server images</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Memory optimized</li>
			<ul>
				<li>R5, R5a, X1e, X1, High Memory, z1d</li>
				<li>Ideal for fast performance worklaods that process large datasets in memory</li>
				<li>Use case: in memory caches, in memory databases, real time big data analytics</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Accelerated Optimized</li>
			<ul>
				<li>P3, P2, G3, F1</li>
				<li>hardware accelerators, or co-processors</li>
				<li>Use case: machine learning, computation finance, seismic analysis, speech recognition</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Storage optimized</li>
			<ul>
				<li>I3, I3en, D2, H1</li>
				<li>Ideal for high sequential read and write access to very large datasets on local storage</li>
				<li>Use case: NoSql, in memory or transactional databases, data warehousing</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Instance Profile</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Instead of embedding your AWS credentials in your code so your instance has permissions to access certain services, you attach a role to an instance via Instance Profile</li>
			<li>The instance profile holds reference to the role</li>
			<li>The EC2 instance is associated with the instance profile</li>
			<li>Automatically created when launching instance via console</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Placement Groups</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Placement groups allow you to choose the logicial placement of your instances to optimize for ...</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Communication</li>
				<li>Performance</li>
				<li>Durability</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Cost: Free</li> 
			<li>Types of placement groups</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Cluster: packs instances close together in AZ. Cluster cannot be multi-AZ</li>
				<li>Partition: spreads instances across logical partitions. Partitions do not share underlying hardware</li>
				<li>Spread: each instance is placed in a seperate rack. Must be multi-AZ</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	
		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>MetaData</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>From within your EC2 instance, you can access information via http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data</li>
			<li>Examples: </li>
			<ul>
				<li>/public-ipv4</li>
				<li>/ami-id</li>
				<li>/instance-type</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Can combine metadata with userdata scripts to perform all sorts of advanced aws staging automation</li>
		</ul>

		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>User Data</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allows you to specify data (such as a script or configuration file) that should be executed when an EC2 instance is launched.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The user data specified when launching an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is only executed once, when the instance is launched</li>
				<li>Once the user data has been executed, it is not executed again unless the instance is stopped and restarted.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The user data is passed to the instance as part of the instance metadata, and can be accessed from within the instance using the EC2 metadata service.</li>
			<li>You can use the user data feature to automate tasks such as installing software packages, configuring the instance, or joining the instance to a domain</li>
			<li>The user data that is specified when launching an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance is executed with root privileges on the instance</li>
		</ul>

		

		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Types of Reserved Instances</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>AWS Reserve Instances are a pricing option for Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS instances that offer a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing.</li>
			<li>Require a one-time payment up front and provide a discounted hourly rate for the duration of the reservation.</li>
			<li>Can be purchased for a period of 1 or 3 years, and the discount is applied to the hourly usage of the instances.</li>
			<li>Flexible and can be exchanged or returned for a full or partial refund within the first 75 days of the reservation.</li>
			<li>Ideal for steady-state or predictable workloads that run for an extended period of time, as they provide a predictable and lower cost for instances over the duration of the reservation.</li>
		
			<li>There are three types of AWS Reserve Instances.</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Standard: offer the highest discount and provide the most flexibility for modifying the instance size or instance family within the same instance type.</li>
				<li>Convertable: offer a lower discount than Standard Reserve Instances, but allow you to exchange the reservation for another instance type within the same instance family, subject to some restrictions.</li>
				<li>Scheduled: allow you to specify the time when your instances will be running in advance, and offer a discount for instances that are running during a specified time window.</li>
			</ol>

		</ul>	


		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Dedicated Host vs Dedicated Instance</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dedicated Hosts</li>
			<ul>
				<li>AWS Dedicated Hosts are physical servers that are dedicated for your use and that you can use to host one or more Amazon EC2 instances.</li>
				<li>You can purchase Dedicated Hosts on a monthly basis and specify the number of instances that you want to run on each host</li>
				<li>Dedicated Hosts give you full visibility and control over the physical infrastructure that your instances are running on, including the hardware, operating system, and virtualization technology.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Dedicated Instance</li>
			<ul>
				<li>AWS Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer</li>
				<li>hey are launched in a VPC and can be used like any other EC2 instances, with the added benefit of being physically isolated from instances that belong to other customers</li>
				<li>They are not tied to a specific host and can be migrated between hosts as needed</li>
				<li>Dedicated Instances are a good option if you want the benefits of running on dedicated infrastructure but do not need the full visibility and control that Dedicated Hosts provide.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		

		<p><span style="font-size: 18;"><strong>Notes</strong></span></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Burst balance: refers to the balance of credits that are available to a burstable performance instance (t2, t3, and t3a instance types).</li>
			<ul>
				<li>When a burstable performance instance is launched, it is allocated a certain number of credits that can be used to support bursts of higher CPU usage</li>
				<li>The instance uses these credits to support bursts of CPU usage that exceed the baseline CPU performance of the instance</li>
				<li>The number of credits that are allocated to an instance is based on the instance type and the size of the instance</li>
				<li>As the instance uses credits to support bursts of CPU usage, the burst balance of the instance decreases. </li>
				<li>When the burst balance reaches zero, the instance's CPU performance will be limited to the baseline performance of the instance until the balance is replenished.</li>
				
			</ul>
		</ul>
